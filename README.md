# Opentimelane

Opentimelane is a debugging tool that collects events from a running program, or
from a log, and displays them on a timeline. Its power is in the ability to
visually inspect asynchronous behavior recorded by any language or platform.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `opentimelane` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

  [

end
```
